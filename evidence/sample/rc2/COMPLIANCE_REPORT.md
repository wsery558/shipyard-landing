# Compliance Report (Sample)

This is a **sample evidence pack** generated from a demo run.
It is intended to show *what* can be exported for auditability and handoffs.

## What this is
- A redacted, exportable snapshot of execution evidence:
  - activity export (JSON)
  - gate report (human-readable)
  - schema for validation

## What this is NOT
- Not a compliance certification.
- Not legal advice.
- Not a guarantee that your system is compliant.

## Included files
- `activity_export.json`
- `activity_event.schema.json`
- `GATE_REPORT.md`
- `COMMERCIAL_REPORT.md`
